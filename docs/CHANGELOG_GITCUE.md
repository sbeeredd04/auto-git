## [0.5.0] - 2025-01-XX

### üß† Intelligent Commit System

#### Smart Activity Tracking
- **Activity Monitoring**: Tracks development activity and waits for it to settle before analyzing changes
- **Prevents Interruptions**: No commits during active development
- **Last Commit Tracking**: Enforces minimum intervals between commits
- **Diff Hashing**: Avoids duplicate AI API calls for unchanged content

#### AI-Enhanced Analysis
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: 
  - Significance: LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH impact assessment
  - Completeness: incomplete (WIP), partial (functional but missing tests/docs), or complete
  - Change Type: feature, bugfix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore, performance, security
  - Risk Level: low, medium, or high (breaking changes, architecture modifications)

#### Configurable Thresholds
- **any**: Commits all meaningful changes
- **medium**: Commits features, bug fixes, meaningful refactoring (default)
- **major**: Only commits significant features and major changes

#### Time-Based Controls
- **Activity Settle Time** (default: 5 minutes): Waits for file changes to stop before analyzing
- **Minimum Time Between Commits** (default: 30 minutes): Prevents too-frequent commits
- **Configurable Buffer Time** (default: 30 seconds): Grace period to cancel commits

#### Auto-Cancellation
- **Cancel on New Changes**: Automatically cancels pending commits when new file changes detected during buffer
- **Manual Cancellation**: Via notification, keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+X), or webview
- **Smart Buffer Management**: Enhanced notifications showing change details

### üìã Configuration Presets

#### Balanced (Default)
- Medium threshold, 30-minute intervals, completeness required
- Best for most development workflows

#### Conservative (Production)
- Major changes only, 1-hour intervals
- Best for production applications and stable branches

#### Frequent (Experimental)
- Any meaningful change, 10-minute intervals
- Best for experimental projects and documentation work

### üìö Documentation

#### New Guides
- **INTELLIGENT_COMMIT_GUIDE.md**: Complete user guide (10KB)
  - Configuration presets and detailed explanations
  - Troubleshooting guide and best practices
  - API reference and CLI comparison
  - System flow diagrams

- **TESTING_GUIDE_INTELLIGENT_COMMIT.md**: Testing guide (9KB)
  - 10 comprehensive test scenarios
  - Verification checklist for all features
  - Performance validation criteria
  - Success criteria and next steps

- **settings.example.json**: Example configuration (3KB)
  - All three presets with detailed comments
  - Timing values in human-readable format
  - Quick reference for threshold options

#### Updated Documentation

  - Added `IntelligentCommitConfig` interface with 6 configurable settings
  - Integrated into main `GitCueConfig` with appropriate defaults
  - Added `getIntelligentCommitConfig()` helper method

  - `makeCommitDecisionWithAI()` accepts threshold and completeness parameters
  - Threshold checking logic with proper significance mapping
  - Enhanced AI prompts with detailed analysis criteria

- **Configuration Schema** (`package.json`):
  - 6 new VS Code settings for intelligent commit control
  - Clear descriptions for each setting
  - Defaults matching proven CLI behavior

### üõ†Ô∏è Quality & Testing
- Build Status: ‚úÖ Successful
